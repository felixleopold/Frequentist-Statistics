    "Breakout is a fun arcade game by *Atari Inc.* from 1976 where you control a small paddle that can move sideways at the bottom of the screen. The goal is to bounce a ball back upwards against placed bricks. Each brick that is broken awards the player with some points. When all bricks are cleared, the player advances to the next level. Whenever the ball is not returned, the player loses a life and can try again in the same level. When all lives are lost, the game is over.\n",

    "Let's say we want to know what the average performance of our player is. If we have access to data from all games (population), it is straightforward to answer questions like this. When we only have sample data, we can approximate the mean of our population using our sample mean. That serves as a good point estimate but it would be useful to also communicate how uncertain we are of that estimate. This can be captured by using a confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the online lecture, you have seen how to calculate a confidence interval for probabilities. We can use a similar method to compute a confidence interval for numerical data. We can calculate a 95% confidence interval for a sample mean by adding and subtracting 1.96 standard errors to the point estimate (this is the z*â€“value). By computing confidence intervals, we can make inferences about what the population means. For numerical data, we can compute the standard error using the formula: SE = $\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt n}$"
