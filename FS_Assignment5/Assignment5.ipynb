    "The movie [Moneyball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)) focuses on the \"quest for the secret of success in baseball\". It follows a low-budget team, the Oakland Athletics who believe that underused statistics, such as a player's ability to get on base, better predict the ability to score runs than typical statistics like home runs, RBIs (runs batted in), and batting average. Obtaining players who excelled in these underused statistics turned out to be much more affordable for the team.\n",

    "In this assignment we'll be looking at data from all 30 Major League Baseball teams from 2011 and examine the linear relationship between runs scored in a season and a number of other player statistics. Our aim will be to summarize these relationships, both graphically and numerically, in order to determine which variable, if any, helps us best predict the runs that a team scored in a season."
