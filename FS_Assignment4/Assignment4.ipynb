    "Non-parameteric testing is a great alternative for datasets such as these. In this workgroup you will learn how you can use randomization to do hypothesis testing. Before we can do the randomization test, we will need to prepare some variables. Because the data are left skewed we will use the median instead of the mean to compare the two consoles. Do the following things:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Calculate the difference in median score of both consoles, and store it in an appropriately named variable.\n",
    " 2. Define how many randomization iterations you want to compute (usually 1000 up to 10000), and create an empty numpy array of this size.\n",
    " 3. Now create a for-loop that loops $n$ times (the number you defined in item 2). Inside the loop, randomly assign each score to a console. Each console should have as many scores as it originally had. \n",

    "2. selecting the first x number of cases that will represent the Xbox 360 games. \n",
