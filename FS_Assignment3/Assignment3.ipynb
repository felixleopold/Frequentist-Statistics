A problem for elderly people is feeling lonely, and the need for interaction. This is where AI can help. Robot pets (i.e., a robot on the inside, stuffed animal on the outside) that react to touch, voice, and act by themselves, can (perhaps) combat this loneliness (real pets usually aren't allowed inside retirement homes).\n",

In this study, the loneliness of elderly people was measured with a questionaire, both at the start of the study (pre-test), and after spending 3 months with their robot pet (post-test). These questions were summarized into two loneliness scores for each individual (one pre- and one post-test score). Elderly were randomly divided into two groups, one group who received a robot dog and another who received a robot cat."
